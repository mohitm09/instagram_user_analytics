# instagram_user_analytics

This project is about user analysis. I was asked to perform user analysis for Instagram and provide insights to product manager on the questions asked by the management team. First it was required to create the database using dataset provided. Then it was required to perform analysis using SQL to answer the below questions:
A) Marketing: 
1.	Rewarding Most Loyal Users: Find the 5 oldest users of the Instagram from the database provided
2.	Remind Inactive Users to Start Posting: Find the users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram
3.	Declaring Contest Winner: Identify the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team
4.	Hashtag Researching: Identify and suggest the top 5 most commonly used hashtags on the platform
5.	Launch AD Campaign: What day of the week do most users register on? Provide insights on when to schedule an ad campaign

B) Investor Metrics: 
1.	User Engagement: Provide how many times does average user posts on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram/total number of users
2.	Bots & Fake Accounts: Provide data on users (bots) who have liked every single photo on the site (since any normal user would not be able to do this).
